#Digital Alarm

Abstract:

There are various types of clocks like pendulum clock,Analog clock and now modern digital clocks.Digital clock as
many advantages over analog clocks like accuracy in time,visibility even in darkness and so on.A digital clock is no different. It simply handles these functions
electronically rather than mechanically. So in a digital clock, there is an electrical power supply (either a battery or 120-volt AC power from the wall).
There is an electronic timebase that "ticks" at some known and accurate rate. There is an electronic "gearing mechanism" of some sort -- generally a digital clock handles
gearing with a component called a "counter." And there is a display, usually either LEDs (light emitting diodes) or an LCD (liquid crystal display).
In this project we are designing a simple alarm clock using Atmega32 microcontroller.
